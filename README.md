### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm ClÃ©ment, a future Data Analyst !
#### Early 2020, after 7 years working as a Business Controller and Internal Auditor, I decided to retrain to the awesome field of Data Analytics and Data Science !
#### I am currently learning all the Tech stuff at a Coding school in Paris, and will get my certification in February 2021

#### Here below are some of the content I created

#### Manipulating and Visualizing Data with Python, and complementary tools

## Projected Population by 2100
Values are based on United Nations forecast of population by country (https://population.un.org/wpp/)

Abilities & tools used:
- Python3 to create and manipulate lists and dataframes (using Pandas library)
