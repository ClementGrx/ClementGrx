### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm ClÃ©ment, a future Data Analyst !
#### Early 2020, after 7 years working as a Business Controller and Internal Auditor, I decided to retrain to the awesome field of Data Analytics and Data Science !
#### I am currently learning all the Tech stuff at a Coding school in Paris, and will get my certification in February 2021
#### From March 2021 on, I would be eager to do a 6 months internship as Data Analyst for a nice Tech company in Paris ... :-)

#### Here below are some of the content I created, and the technics used to achieve this !

##### Manipulating and Visualizing Data with Python, and complementary tools

1. Projected Population by 2100
Values are based on United Nations forecast of population by country (https://population.un.org/wpp/)

In order to make this bar chart plot, I used :
 - Python3 to create and manipulate lists and dataframes (using Pandas library)
 - BeautifulSoup to scrape a website to retrieve countries' flags
 - Feature engineering using some lambda functions, apply() method, and a library to convert countries codes to continent codes (pycountry-convert)
 - Floorish Studio bar chart race tool (https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4247040/)
