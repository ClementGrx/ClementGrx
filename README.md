### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm ClÃ©ment, a future Data Analyst !
#### Early 2020, after 7 years working as a Business Controller and Internal Auditor, I decided to retrain to the field of Data Analytics and Data Science !
#### I am currently studying at a Coding school in Paris and will get my certification in February 2021 (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Statistics...).  

#### Here below are some of the content I created.

## Project #1 : Projected Population by 2100
Values are based on United Nations forecast of population by country (https://population.un.org/wpp/)

Abilities & tools used:
- Python3 to create and manipulate lists and dataframes (using Pandas library)
- BeautifulSoup library to scrape a website to retrieve countries' flags
- Feature engineering using some lambda functions, apply() method, and another library to convert countries codes to continent codes (pycountry-convert)
- Flourish Studio bar chart race tool (https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4247040/)

## Project #2 : my first 24-hours internal Hackathon

- Thursday 19th November - 10am -> Friday 20th Nov - 3pm. 
- Topic : "the Real Estate Market". 
- Required outputs : to define a problem, and to solve it with a creative solution using Python and any Data Visualisation tool or library.

Together with my 5 teammates, we decided to address the French housing market, and help real estate agencies define the best cities in France where to open a new agency.
In less than 24 hours, as a team (remotely!), we implemented a scoring of each city in France, to synthetize the local real estate market dynamics.
We processed all the data using Python (mainly Pandas).
We chose to use 5 features, based on governmental Data, by city :
- % of working / active population
- % of population growth
- number of inhabitants
- number of yearly transaction / inhabitant
- mean value of transactions

Our outputs :
- the scoring itself (from 1 to 100), shown on a map (Python Mapbox):

Here are two maps representing two of the five features behind the scoring:

- a dynamic Dashboard (on Tableau Software), which allows to analyse more features, for any chosen city in France.

Here are some additional information :

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m very comfortable with Python, SQL, and the first Machine Learning techniques I learned (for now : uni- multivariate Linear Regressions, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement other Machine Learning models (KNN, Random Forest, K-means...)
