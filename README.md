### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm ClÃ©ment, a future Data Analyst !
#### Early 2020, after 7 years working as a Business Controller and Internal Auditor, I decided to retrain to the awesome field of Data Analytics and Data Science !
#### I am currently studying at a Coding school in Paris, and will get my certification in February 2021 (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Statistics...).  

#### Here below are some of the content I created.  
   


## Project #1 : Projected Population by 2100
Values are based on United Nations forecast of population by country (https://population.un.org/wpp/)

Abilities & tools used:
- Python3 to create and manipulate lists and dataframes (using Pandas library)
- BeautifulSoup to scrape a website to retrieve countries' flags
- Feature engineering using some lambda functions, apply() method, and a library to convert countries codes to continent codes (pycountry-convert)
- Floorish Studio bar chart race tool (https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4247040/)

## Project #3 : Choosing best Machine Learning algorithm to solve a business case

In progress !

Here are some additional information :

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m very comfortable with Python, SQL, and the first Machine Learning techniques I learned (for now : uni- multivariate linear regressions, logistic regression)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement other Machine Learning models (SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-means, DBscan)
